Projectional editor written in Golang

## Projectional editor
A projectional editor is similar to the concept of projectional radiology, but
applied to code.
It is a way to view the underlying structure of code and edit it in new ways.
All code has an underlying syntax tree which compilers use to interpret code.
Projectional editors access that tree and use it to build different ways to view
 code.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use abstract syntax trees as a central authority
for a code base, disassociating code storage from how it is edited and viewed.
